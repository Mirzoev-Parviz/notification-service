# Notification Service

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the repository
To get started, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mirzoev-Parviz/notification_service.git
cd notification_service
```

### Step 2: Configure the Database
Create a PostgreSQL database and then configure the `config.yaml` file (you'll need to create this file based on the provided `config.example.yaml`):

```yaml
dbSettings:
  user: your_db_user
  password: your_db_password
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  database: notification_db
  sslmode: disable
```

Ensure you fill in your actual database credentials.

### Step 3: Build the Project
Build the project by running the following command:

```bash
go build -o notification_service ./cmd/main.go
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Once built, you can start the application by running:

```bash
./notification_service
```

The application should start and listen on `localhost:8080`.

### Step 5: Send Events
You can now send POST requests with card events to `http://localhost:8080/event`.
